What the project does 


This project is an animated, scrollable website about sustainable goal 14. Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. 
In the project we are using advanced CSS features, CSS architecture, Sass, BEM, SVG, keyframe animations, transitions and transformations. 

This site features scrolling narration, implemented using Intersection Observer, and includes accessibility features such as "prefer-color-scheme" to ensure an optimal user experience.
The primary objective of the project is to educate users about Sustainable Development Goal 14, which focuses on ocean conservation and sustainable use of marine resources. This is achieved through a combination of storytelling, animations, layout, and typography, which are designed to engage and inform users about the importance of protecting our oceans.


Why the project is useful

This project aims to raise awareness about United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water. Through an engaging scrollytelling experience, it educates individuals about the importance of protecting and sustainably managing our oceans, seas, and marine resources. By showcasing the challenges faced by marine ecosystems and offering actionable solutions, the project encourages people to become advocates for Goal 14 and contribute to a healthier and more sustainable future for our planet.
